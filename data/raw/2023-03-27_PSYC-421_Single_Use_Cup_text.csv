Introduction and Purpose
Students in the PSYC 421 – Environment Psychology class are required to complete a research project on the UBC campus as part of their course credit. In this class, students are required to write up a research proposal, conduct a research project, collect and analyze data, present their findings in class, and submit a final report. Their final reports will be published on the SEEDS online library (https://sustain.ubc.ca/teaching-applied-learning/seeds-sustainability-program). Their projects include online surveys and experiments on a variety of sustainability topics, such as waste sorting on campus, student health and wellbeing, food consumption and diet, transportation, biodiversity perception, and exercise habits. The goal of the project is to train students to learn research techniques, how to work in teams and work with UBC clients selected by the UBC SEEDS (Social Ecological Economic Development Studies) program.

Study Procedures

If you agree to participate, the study will take about 10 minutes of your time. You will answer a few questions in the study. The data will be strictly anonymous. Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any point without any penalty. Your data in the study will be recorded (e.g., any answer you give) for data analysis purposes. If you are not sure about any instructions, please do not hesitate to ask. Your data will only be used for student projects in the class. There are no risks associated with participating in this experiment.

Confidentiality

Your identity will be kept strictly confidential. All documents will be identified only by code number and kept in a locked filing cabinet. You will not be identified by name in any reports of the completed study. Data that will be kept on a computer hard disk will also be identified only by code number and will be encrypted and password protected so that only the principal investigator and course instructor, Dr. Jiaying Zhao and the teaching assistants will have access to it. Following the completion of the study, the data will be transferred to an encrypted and password protected hard drive and stored in a locked filing cabinet. Please note that the results of this study will be used to write a report which is published on the SEEDS library.

Remuneration

There is no remuneration for your participation.
