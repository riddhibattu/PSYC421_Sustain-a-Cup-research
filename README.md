# PSYC 421: Environmental Sustainability Project at UBC

## Overview

This project explores environmental sustainability practices at the University of British Columbia (UBC), focusing on behaviors related to single-use cups. Guided by Dr. Jiaying Zhao and the SEEDS program, we analyzed interventions to influence the use of single-use versus reusable cups.

## Objectives

- To analyze the effectiveness of "Gain," "Loss," and "Control" interventions on single-use cup behavior.
- To assess the impact on reducing single-use cups and increasing reusable cup usage.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Survey data from 258 UBC participants using Qualtrics; 253 valid responses after excluding missing values.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and coding survey responses.
  - **Statistical Analysis**:
    - **Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances**: No evidence of variance inequality, validating ANOVA assumptions.
    - **Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality**: Residuals from ANOVAs did not follow normal distribution, necessitating the use of Kruskal-Wallis tests.
    - **Kruskal-Wallis Test and Dunn’s Test** for post-hoc analysis on non-parametric data.

## Results

### Q2: Surprisingness of Information
- **Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 18.661, df = 2, p < 0.0001**: Significant differences in perceived surprisingness.
- **Dunn’s Test**:
  - **Control vs. Gain**: Significant difference (p = 0.0007).
  - **Control vs. Loss**: Significant difference (p = 0.0001).
  - **Gain vs. Loss**: No significant difference (p = 1.0000).

### Q3: Likelihood of Reducing Single-Use Cups
- **Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 5.233, df = 2, p = 0.072**: No significant differences among conditions.

### Q4: Likelihood of Bringing Reusable Cups
- **Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 8.761, df = 2, p = 0.012**: Significant differences in likelihood of bringing reusable cups.
- **Dunn’s Test**:
  - **Control vs. Gain**: No significant difference (p = 0.4809).
  - **Control vs. Loss**: Significant difference (p = 0.0054).
  - **Gain vs. Loss**: No significant difference (p = 0.0882).

## Conclusions and Recommendations

- **Loss-framed interventions** are more effective in promoting reusable cup usage compared to control, but not significantly different from gain-framed messages.
- Future research should explore combining different types of interventions with loss-framed messages for enhanced sustainability practices on campus.
