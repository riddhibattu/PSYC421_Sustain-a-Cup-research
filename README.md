# PSYC 421: Environmental Sustainability Project at UBC

## Overview

This project aims to explore environmental sustainability practices at the University of British Columbia (UBC), focusing specifically on behaviors related to the use of single-use cups. Under the guidance of Dr. Jiaying Zhao (JZ) and the SEEDS program, our team has conducted a detailed analysis to understand how different interventions might influence people' likelihood of using single-use cups versus bringing their own reusable cups.

## Objectives

- To analyze the effectiveness of different intervention strategies ("Gain", "Loss", "Control") on individuals' behaviors towards using single-use cups.
- To assess the impact of these interventions on individuals likelihood of:
  - Reducing the use of single-use cups.
  - Bringing their own reusable cups for beverage purchases.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Survey (Qualtrics) data was collected from participants at UBC, including questions on their current behaviors and responses to hypothetical intervention scenarios.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Preprocessing involved selecting relevant survey questions, cleaning the data, and coding responses for analysis.
  - Statistical analyses included One-Way ANOVA tests to compare means between groups, followed by post-hoc Tukey's HSD tests for pairwise comparisons.

## Results -> update as we collect more data

- Significant differences were found in the likelihood of bringing reusable cups between the "Loss" condition and both the "Control" and "Gain" conditions, indicating that loss-framed interventions might be more effective in promoting sustainable behaviors.
- No significant differences were observed in the likelihood of reducing single-use cups across conditions, suggesting that additional factors or interventions might be necessary to influence this behavior.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

- Loss-framed interventions appear to be a promising approach to encourage the use of reusable cups among UBC students.
- Future research could explore other types of interventions, potentially combining them with loss-framed messages, to further enhance sustainability practices on campus.
