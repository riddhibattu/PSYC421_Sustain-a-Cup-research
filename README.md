# PSYC 421: Environmental Sustainability Project at UBC

## Overview

This project aims to explore environmental sustainability practices at the University of British Columbia (UBC), focusing specifically on behaviors related to the use of single-use cups. Under the guidance of Dr. Jiaying Zhao (JZ) and the SEEDS program, our team conducted a detailed analysis to understand how different interventions might influence people's likelihood of using single-use cups versus bringing their own reusable cups.

## Objectives

- To analyze the effectiveness of different intervention strategies ("Gain", "Loss", "Control") on individuals' behaviors towards using single-use cups.
- To assess the impact of these interventions on individuals' likelihood of:
  - Reducing the use of single-use cups.
  - Bringing their own reusable cups for beverage purchases.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Survey data was collected from 258 participants at UBC using Qualtrics, including questions on their current behaviors and responses to hypothetical intervention scenarios. After excluding 5 missing values, the total sample size for analysis was N = 253.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - **Preprocessing** involved selecting relevant survey questions, cleaning the data, and coding responses for analysis.
  - **Statistical Analysis** for N = 253 total. The data was subjected to One-Way ANOVA tests to compare means between the "Gain," "Loss," and "Control" conditions, followed by post-hoc Tukey's HSD tests for pairwise comparisons.
  - **Count by Condition Assigned**:

    | ConditionAssigned | Count |
    |-------------------|------:|
    | Loss              |    86 |
    | Control           |    83 |
    | Gain              |    84 |
    | *5 values unassigned (NaN)* |

## Results

- **Surprisingness of Information (Q2)**: Significant differences were observed in how surprising the information was perceived across different conditions, indicating the framing of information significantly affects participants' perceptions.
  
- **Likelihood of Reducing Single-Use Cups (Q3)**: There was no statistically significant difference across conditions, suggesting the framing alone might not be sufficient to significantly change the behavior towards reducing the use of single-use cups.
  
- **Likelihood of Bringing Reusable Cups (Q4)**: Significant differences were found in the likelihood of bringing reusable cups between the "Loss" condition and both the "Control" and "Gain" conditions. This suggests that loss-framed interventions might be more effective in promoting sustainable behaviors than gain-framed or neutral messages.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

- Loss-framed interventions appear to be a promising approach to encourage the use of reusable cups among the UBC community. They effectively influenced the likelihood of bringing one's own reusable cup, though they did not significantly impact the intention to reduce single-use cup usage.
- Future research could explore other types of interventions, potentially combining them with loss-framed messages, to further enhance sustainability practices on campus. The exploration of additional factors that might influence the reduction of single-use cup usage could provide further insights into effective environmental sustainability strategies.
